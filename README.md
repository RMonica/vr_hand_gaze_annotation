vr_hand_gaze_annotation
=======================

Point cloud annotation tool with hand and gaze tracking in virtual reality in Unity.

This repository also supports annotation using bounding boxes. The code was integrated from [PointAtMe](https://github.com/florianwirth/PointAtMe).

The reference paper is still under review.

Ground truth point clouds used in the paper can be downloaded from <https://rimlab.ce.unipr.it/~rmonica/vr2025_clouds_and_ground_truth.zip>.
